# Feature Specification: The Eidolon

**Spec ID:** 0011-eidolon-architecture
**Status:** Draft

**Input:** The complete architecture for Intellectual Frontiers' Eidolon — repository
topology, namespace conventions, the confidentiality model, the facts and reference
model, and governance representation. This is the current and sole statement of how
the Eidolon works. It is not an addition alongside an earlier treatment of any of
these subjects; where an existing file describes governance, confidentiality, or the
ontology namespace differently, this spec is the one to build toward.

## Repository topology

- **FR-001**: The Eidolon MUST consist of exactly three repositories with distinct
  roles: a public root (`.github`), a private extension (`eidolon`), and a consuming
  web property (`www.intellectualfrontiers.com`).
- **FR-002**: The public root MUST contain only Public-tier facts, specs, and
  ontology. Nothing of any other confidentiality classification may be asserted
  there, regardless of how it is labeled.
- **FR-003**: The private extension MUST hold every non-public spec and ontology
  individual for Intellectual Frontiers LLC. It MUST `owl:imports` the public root's
  ontology and MUST NOT redefine or remove anything the public root declares.
- **FR-004**: A legal entity formed to hold third-party capital (a fund) MUST receive
  its own, separate Eidolon — its own public and private roots — rather than being
  represented inside Intellectual Frontiers LLC's Eidolon. It MAY inherit from
  Intellectual Frontiers' public root the way a venture inherits a unit's spec.
- **FR-005**: Persistence for both the public and private Eidolon MUST be plain Git,
  hosted on GitHub. Live, network-mounted content sources are out of scope for the
  current architecture.

## Namespaces

- **FR-006**: The company's human-facing acronym MUST remain "IF" in all prose,
  branding, and documentation.
- **FR-007**: The machine-facing RDF/OWL namespace prefixes MUST be `ifcore:` for the
  core company ontology, `ifweb:` for web content shapes, and `ifpriv:` for the
  private extension ontology. No ontology file may use a bare `if:` prefix.

## The vault

- **FR-008**: Clone access to the `eidolon` repository MUST be limited to a small,
  explicitly named circle: the founder and a close team bound by legal
  confidentiality agreements.
- **FR-009**: Every party outside that circle — employees not in the circle, NDA'd
  external counterparties, and the public — MUST access anything in `eidolon` only
  through an authenticated, mediated interface (the website, or another proxy such
  as a synced file share), never through direct repository access.
- **FR-010**: Within the vault circle, trust MUST be flat: no sub-tiering of
  confidentiality is enforced between vault members by the ontology or by repository
  permissions. Differentiation between Public, Internal, Confidential, and
  Highly-Restricted audiences is enforced only at the proxy layer, for viewers
  outside the vault.

## Confidentiality classification

- **FR-011**: Every fact asserted anywhere in the Eidolon MUST declare the
  audience(s) permitted to see it. An audience is one of: everyone, anyone
  affiliated with the company, a specific named agreement, or a specific named role
  or group.
- **FR-012**: A fact with no declared audience MUST default to the most restrictive
  available audience.
- **FR-013**: A fact listing more than one audience is visible to a viewer who
  satisfies any one of them, not all of them.
- **FR-014**: Audiences MUST NOT be modeled as a single linear tier. A viewer's
  clearance for one audience does not imply clearance for another, even one that
  reads as "lower."
- **FR-015**: A reference record (see Facts, below) is itself a fact and MUST carry
  its own audience declaration — the existence of a reference is not automatically
  as visible as its surrounding context.

## The sensitivity test

- **FR-016**: A fact MUST be classified as sensitive — ineligible to be stored as a
  literal anywhere in the Eidolon, public or private — when any of the following
  hold: (a) it is a third party's confidential information held under Intellectual
  Frontiers' own confidentiality obligation to them; (b) it is personally
  identifying information about any real individual; (c) its broader internal
  visibility creates legal or security risk independent of how trusted the audience
  is; (d) it is a personal financial term of an individual inside the company.
- **FR-017**: A new category of sensitive fact MUST be classified by applying
  FR-016 at the time it arises. No pre-approval or central registry of categories is
  required before a new category can be classified.
- **FR-018**: When a fact's classification under FR-016 is genuinely unclear, it
  MUST be treated as sensitive until a deliberate decision establishes otherwise.

## Facts: single source of truth

- **FR-019**: A fact MUST be stored as a literal value in exactly one place —
  wherever its single authoritative source is. Every other location MUST hold a
  reference to that source, never a duplicate value.
- **FR-020**: A fact with no external authoritative source and no sensitivity
  classification under FR-016 MAY be stored as a literal directly in its owning
  repository (`.github` if Public, `eidolon` otherwise).
- **FR-021**: A fact classified as sensitive under FR-016 MUST NOT be stored as a
  literal in any Eidolon repository. It MUST be represented as a
  `RestrictedDataReference`.

## Reference types

- **FR-022**: An `ExternalRecordReference` MUST be used for a fact whose
  authoritative source is outside Intellectual Frontiers' control (a government
  registry, a counterparty's own record). It MUST carry the location of the primary
  source, MAY carry a cached value, and if it carries a cached value MUST carry the
  date that value was last verified against the source.
- **FR-023**: A `RestrictedDataReference` MUST be used for a fact classified as
  sensitive under FR-016. It MUST carry which external system holds the real data
  and the process for requesting access to it. It MUST NOT have any field capable of
  holding the fact's actual value, and MUST NOT, under any circumstance, hold a
  credential, password, or access secret — only a description of how a properly
  authorized person obtains one.
- **FR-024**: Every `ExternalRecordReference` MUST declare a re-verification cadence
  and a verification method (automated or manual). Whether its cached value is
  currently overdue for re-verification MUST be derivable from its last-verified
  date and its cadence.
- **FR-025**: An overdue `ExternalRecordReference` MUST default to the founder's
  responsibility for re-verification unless a specific role has been delegated that
  responsibility.

## Rendering facts into static or non-live output

- **FR-026**: Any resolved value from an `ExternalRecordReference` that is captured
  into a static or non-live artifact (a document, a slide, a quoted figure, a
  generated page) MUST be stamped, visibly, with the date it was resolved as of.
- **FR-027**: A `RestrictedDataReference` MUST NOT be resolved into any static or
  non-live artifact. Such an artifact may state that the fact exists and how to
  request it; it MUST NOT contain the fact's value.

## Governance

- **FR-028**: Intellectual Frontiers LLC MUST be modeled as a single-member LLC with
  no third-party or limited-partner capital inside it. A legal entity formed to hold
  third-party capital MUST be a separate LLC, per FR-004.
- **FR-029**: Shahid Nehal Shah MUST be the default decision authority for every
  domain not explicitly delegated elsewhere. A delegation MUST be additive —
  granting a named role authority over a specific domain — and MUST NOT require a
  corresponding revocation from the default authority to take effect.
- **FR-030**: A decision MUST be checked against the authority in effect at the time
  the decision was made, not the authority in effect when the decision is later
  reviewed.
- **FR-031**: A recorded decision MUST correspond to one of the five
  decision-checkpoint outcomes: continue, change, back someone else, build it, or
  stop. Routine operational activity MUST NOT require a recorded decision
  individual.
- **FR-032**: Decision-recording practice MUST be sized for a single-member LLC:
  lightweight, useful to the founder, without formal multi-stakeholder process
  overhead. This MUST be revisited if the company's structure changes.
- **FR-033**: A decision touching assets Intellectual Frontiers LLC wholly owns MUST
  NOT be held to a higher evidentiary standard than any other decision, because, per
  FR-028, no third-party asset currently sits inside this entity. FR-004's
  separate-Eidolon-per-fund requirement is what carries a higher standard whenever
  third-party capital becomes relevant.

## Open questions

- **OQ-1**: No emergency or successor decision authority is defined for when the
  founder is unreachable.

## Spec maintenance

- **FR-034**: A spec MUST state only the current architecture and the intended
  future state. It MUST NOT contain change narration, dated provenance notes,
  session logs, changelogs, or resolved-question history.
- **FR-035**: Every Git commit that changes a spec or ontology file MUST carry a
  commit message stating what changed and why. Historical context belongs in commit
  messages, never in the spec itself.
- **FR-036**: If data violating the confidentiality model (FR-016, FR-021, FR-023)
  is discovered to have been committed to any Eidolon repository, rewriting that
  repository's Git history to remove it from all reachable history is REQUIRED, not
  discretionary. Any credential or secret that may have been exposed by the
  improper commit MUST also be rotated — a history rewrite alone does not undo
  exposure to anyone who already held a copy before the rewrite.

## Key entities

- **The Eidolon** — the three-repository system (`.github`, `eidolon`,
  `www.intellectualfrontiers.com`) that models and serves everything Intellectual
  Frontiers knows about itself.
- **The vault** — the `eidolon` repository and the small, named, legally-bound
  circle with direct clone access to it.
- **An audience** — a named permission to see a fact: everyone, company
  affiliation, a specific agreement, or a specific role or group.
- **A `Reference`** — a fact that points at a value held elsewhere rather than
  storing the value itself; carries its own audience declaration.
- **An `ExternalRecordReference`** — a `Reference` to a fact Intellectual Frontiers
  does not author or control, optionally caching a dated snapshot of it.
- **A `RestrictedDataReference`** — a `Reference` to a sensitive fact Intellectual
  Frontiers does author, deliberately excluded from every Eidolon repository, with
  no field able to hold the value itself.
- **The decision checkpoint** — the five possible outcomes of a recorded decision:
  continue, change, back someone else, build it, stop.

## Review & acceptance checklist

- [x] Every requirement is testable (MUST / MUST NOT), not aspirational
- [x] No production mechanics (specific tools, file formats, hosting details) —
      those belong to an implementation plan, not this spec
- [x] Every open item is marked, not silently decided
- [x] Public-safe: no confidential information, no unverified number stated as
      settled fact
